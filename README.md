# My first ever project
Created with CodeSandbox

My very first project, before starting my Full Stack Web & App Development Bootcamp at WBS Coding School. During the preparation for the course, we were asked to create our first little project, using the skills we have acquired before starting the actual course. A friendly reminder of how it all started.
